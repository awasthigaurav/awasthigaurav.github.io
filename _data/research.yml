  description: Analyzed the associations between the luminal-basal (L-B) and epithelial-mesenchymal (E-M) nature of cells by comparing correlations between the individual L-B and E-M characteristics. Performed perturbation analysis on possible gene network topologies and implemented clustering algorithms on the steady states to compare them with observed cell phenotypes
