Hello there! I'm Gaurav, currently a final-year undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay. I'm pursuing my B.Tech in Chemical Engineering (with honors). \
I enjoy learning new things, meeting new people and just new experiences in general. I'm fairly enthusiastic about a career in research at the moment, and hope to one day work at the intersection of science and business. I have been involved in a fairly diverse set of activities throughout my time as an undergrad, and have attempted to detail some of them here on my little corner of the Internet.

## Research: 
My current interests revolve around the mathematical and physical modeling of biological systems. I'm also interested in computational soft matter and polymers. \
I've tried my best to get a flavour of research as an undergrad, and have been lucky to find amazing mentors to guide me while I attempt to do so. Some of the highlights are mentioned here, see the Projects section or my CV (linked above) for details:
 - Currently pursuing a project on modeling granular flow in a rotating cylinder under Prof. Devang Khakhar, IIT Bombay.
 - Undergraduate research intern at the Cancer Systems Biology Lab at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru under the guidance of Prof. Mohit Jolly. I worked on a project aimed to uncover the associations between the luminal-basal nature with the epithelial-mesenchymal nature by comparing how the individual luminal, basal, epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics are correlated.
 - I worked at the Computational Mechanics and Materials Research Group at IIT Bombay under Prof. Anirban Patra, where I contributed to modeling solidification of additively manufactured metals using phase-field models in MOOSE. I also developed an image-processing pipeline to compare simulated microstructural attributes with experimental data. I received the Undergraduate Research Award (URA 01) for my work!
 - I worked under Prof. Sanjeeva Srivastava at the Proteomics Laboratory, IIT Bombay. I learnt the fundamentals of mass spectrometry-based proteomics and contributed to identifying differentially expressed proteins in nasal swab samples of COVID-19 patients during the second wave of the pandemic in India.

### Skills:
I have been fortunate enough to pick up a few skills along my exciting research journey, and hope to continue expanding this list!
 - Software: LAMMPS, Ovito, RACIPE, DWSIM, MOOSE, ParaView, OpenFOAM, Gmsh
 - Programming: Python, MATLAB, R, C++, LATEX, Shell (Bash)
 
## Activities that I have been a part of:
 - Senior Editor at Insight, IIT Bombay's official student media body; after serving as an Editorial Board Member for 2022-23. I received the Institute Journalism Color for my work, given to a maximum of 2 out of the institute's 13000+ students.
- Student Mentor:
  - Institute Student Mentor (ISMP): Mentoring 12 freshmen from diverse backgrounds to ensure a smooth transition into college life
  - Senior Mentor and Sub-group Head (D-AMP): Guiding 2 students part of the institute's Academic Rehabilitation Program. Additionally heading the Blogs & Resources Sub-group of the ChemE D-AMP, leading a team of 13.
  - Department Academic Mentor: Guided 6 sophomores in making informed decisions in their academic and extra-curricular pursuits
- Convener, Chemical Engineering Tinkerers' Laboratory: I was part of a four-member team that established a completely student-run lab focusing on applied chemical engineering projects
- Teaching Assistant: Freshman BB101 - Introduction to Biology course at IIT Bombay 
  
## Hobbies and other interests:
I've been shifting places since childhood, am always up for travel, and you can count me in for any long walks or bicycle rides :)

I'm fairly into sports -- I enjoy swimming, the occasional round of golf, and also play some badminton. I'm trying to learn new languages, and seem to have made some progress with Spanish -- hit me up if you ever want a practice buddy!

I love music, particularly '90s rock; U2 are personal favourites. I'm also a big fan of the Star Wars and Disney-Pixar movies. *Yes Minister* and *Yes Prime Minister* remain my favourite TV shows to date, with *Phineas and Ferb* being the only real contender for the top spot in my list.

I greatly enjoy newspaper comics, with *Calvin and Hobbes* being an all-time favourite. I'm also an avid reader (fantasy fiction, crime and thrillers, though I have recently ventured into non-fiction as well) and an occasional writer (particularly poetry).
