Hello there! I'm Gaurav, currently a final-year undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay. I'm pursuing my B.Tech in Chemical Engineering (with honors). \
I enjoy learning new things, meeting new people and just new experiences in general. I'm fairly enthusiastic about a career in research at the moment, and hope to one day work at the intersection of science and business. With an aim to get some industrial exposure and learn how my academic courses translate to the real world, I will be joining Unilever as an R&D intern at their Mumbai office this summer (2023).

## Research:
I'm trying my best to explore some diverse research areas throughout my time as an undergrad, and so far, have been lucky to find amazing mentors to guide me while I attempt to do so. Some of the highlights are mentioned here, see my CV (linked above) for details:
 - As an undergraduate research intern at the Cancer Systems Biology Lab at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru under the guidance of Prof. Mohit Jolly. I worked on a project aimed to uncover the associations between the luminal-basal nature with the epithelial-mesenchymal nature by comparing how the individual luminal, basal, epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics are correlated
 - I worked at the Computational Mechanics and Materials Research Group at IIT Bombay under Prof. Anirban Patra, where I contributed to modeling solidification of additively manufactured metals using phase-field models in MOOSE. I also developed an image-processing pipeline to compare simulated microstructural attributes with experimental data
    - I received the Undergraduate Research Award (URA 01) for my work!
 - I worked under Prof. Sanjeeva Srivastava at the Proteomics Laboratory, IIT Bombay. I learnt the fundamentals of mass spectrometry-based proteomics and contributed to identifying differentially expressed proteins in nasal swab samples of COVID-19 patients during the second wave of the pandemic in India
 
## Activities that I have been a part of:
 - I'm currently a Senior Editor at Insight, IIT Bombay's official student media body, after having served as an Editorial Board Member for 2022-23
 - Serving as a Department Academic Mentor (under the aegis of the Student Mentor Programme, IIT Bombay) guiding 5 sophomores in their academic and extra-curricular pursuits
  - Worked as one of the conveners of the Chemical Engineering Tinkerers' Laboratory, where I was part of a four-member team that established a completely student-run lab focusing on applied chemical engineering projects
  - Served as a Teaching Assistant for the freshman BB101 - Biology course at IIT Bombay 
  
## Hobbies and other interests:
I've been shifting places since childhood, am always up for travel, and you can count me in for any long walks or bicycle rides :)

I'm fairly into sports -- I enjoy swimming, the occasional round of golf, and also play some badminton. I'm trying to learn new languages, and seem to have made some progress with Spanish -- hit me up if you ever want a practice buddy!

I love music, particularly '90s rock; U2 are personal favourites. I'm also a big fan of the Star Wars and Disney-Pixar movies. *Yes Minister* and *Yes Prime Minister* remain my favourite TV shows to date.

I greatly enjoy newspaper comics, with Calvin and Hobbes being an all-time favourite. I'm also an avid reader (fantasy fiction, crime and thrillers, though I have recently ventured into non-fiction as well) and an occasional writer (particularly poetry).
