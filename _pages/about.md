Hello there! I'm Gaurav, currently a third-year undergrad at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay. I'm pursuing my B.Tech in Chemical Engineering (with honors) along with a minor in Healthcare Informatics. \
I am quite entusiastic about research at the moment, and hope to one day work at the intersection of science and business. With an aim to get some industrial exposure and learn how my academic courses translate to the real world, I will be joining Unilever as an R&D intern at their Mumbai office this summer (2023).

## Research:
I'm trying my best to explore some diverse research areas throughout my time here, and so far, have been lucky to find amazing mentors to guide me while I attempt to do so.
 - I am currently working as an undergraduate research intern at the Cancer Systems Biology Lab at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore under the guidance of Prof. Mohit Jolly
 - I have been working at the Computational Mechanics and Materials Research Group at IIT Bombay under Prof. Anirban Patra, where I am contributing to modeling solidification of additively manufactured metals using phase-field models in MOOSE
 - I worked under Prof. Sanjeeva Srivastava at the Proteomics Laboratory, IIT Bombay. I learnt the fundamentals of mass spectrometry-based proteomics and contributed to identifying differentially expressed proteins in nasal swab samples of COVID-19 patients during the second wave of the pandemic in India
 
## Activities that I have been a part of:
 - I'm an Editorial Board Member at Insight, IIT Bombay's official student media body
 - Serving as a Department Academic Mentor (under the aegis of the Student Mentor Programme, IIT Bombay) guiding 5 sophomores in their academic and extra-curricular pursuits
  - Worked as one of the conveners of the Chemical Engineering Tinkerers' Laboratory, where I was part of a four-member team that established a completely student-run lab focusing on applied chemical engineering projects
  - Served as a Teaching Assistant for the freshman BB101 - Biology course at IIT Bombay 
  
## Hobbies and other interests:
I'm fairly into sports -- I enjoy swimming, the occasional round of golf, and also play table tennis and badminton.

I love music, particularly '90s rock; U2 are personal favourites. I'm also a big fan of the Star Wars and Disney-Pixar movies.

I greatly enjoy newspaper comics, with Calvin and Hobbes being an all-time favourite. I'm also an avid reader (fantasy fiction, crime and thrillers, though I have recently ventured into non-fiction as well) and an occasional writer (particularly poetry).
